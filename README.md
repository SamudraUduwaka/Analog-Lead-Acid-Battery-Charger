# Analog-Lead-Acid-Battery-Charger

As a group of second-year undergraduates, we made a lead-acid battery charger for the analog project in semester 3. It is capable of charging a 12V-1A lead-acid battery with two charging modes (constant current/constant voltage), connected with a switching circuit, buck converter, and a power supply circuit.
